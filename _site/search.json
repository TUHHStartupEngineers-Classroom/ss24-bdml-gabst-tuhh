The Sales Department is very interested in this analysis, which will help them more easily penetrate various market segments.\nYou will be using stock prices in this analysis. You come up with a method to classify companies based on how their stocks trade using their daily stock returns (percentage movement from one day to the next). This analysis will help your organization determine which companies are related to each other (competitors and have similar attributes).\nYou can analyze the stock prices using what you’ve learned in the unsupervised learning tools including K-Means and UMAP.

The most important columns for our analysis are:\nsymbol: The stock ticker symbol that corresponds to a company’s stock price\ndate: The timestamp relating the symbol to the share price at that point in time\nadjusted: The stock price, adjusted for any splits and dividends (we use this when analyzing stock data over long periods of time)\n\n# STOCK PRICES\nsp_500_prices_tbl &lt;- readRDS(\"C:/Projekte/bdml/sp_500_prices_tbl.rds\")\nsp_500_prices_tbl\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe second data frame contains information about the stocks the most important of which are:\ncompany: The company name\nsector: The sector that the company belongs to\n\n# SECTOR INFORMATION\nsp_500_index_tbl &lt;- read_rds(\"C:/Projekte/bdml/sp_500_index_tbl.rds\")\nsp_500_index_tbl\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich stock prices behave similarly?\nAnswering this question helps us understand which companies are related, and we can use clustering to help us answer it!\nEven if you’re not interested in finance, this is still a great analysis because it will tell you which companies are competitors and which are likely in the same space (often called sectors) and can be categorized together. Bottom line - This analysis can help you better understand the dynamics of the market and competition, which is useful for all types of analyses from finance to sales to marketing.\nLet’s get started.\nStep 1 - Convert stock prices to a standardized format (daily returns)\nWhat you first need to do is get the data in a format that can be converted to a “user-item” style matrix. The challenge here is to connect the dots between what we have and what we need to do to format it properly.\nWe know that in order to compare the data, it needs to be standardized or normalized. Why? Because we cannot compare values (stock prices) that are of completely different magnitudes. In order to standardize, we will convert from adjusted stock price (dollar value) to daily returns (percent change from previous day). Here is the formula.\n\\[\nreturn_{daily} = \\frac{price_{i}-price_{i-1}}{price_{i-1}}\n\\]\nFirst, what do we have? We have stock prices for every stock in the SP 500 Index, which is the daily stock prices for over 500 stocks. The data set is over 1.2M observations.\n{r} sp_500_prices_tbl %&gt;% glimpse()\nYour first task is to convert to a tibble named sp_500_daily_returns_tbl by performing the following operations:\nSelect the symbol, date and adjusted columns\nFilter to dates beginning in the year 2018 and beyond.\nCompute a Lag of 1 day on the adjusted stock price. Be sure to group by symbol first, otherwise we will have lags computed using values from the previous stock in the data frame.\nRemove a NA values from the lagging operation\nCompute the difference between adjusted and the lag\nCompute the percentage difference by dividing the difference by that lag. Name this column pct_return.\nReturn only the symbol, date, and pct_return columns\nSave as a variable named sp_500_daily_returns_tbl\n{r} # Apply your data transformation skills!\n\n1 Output: sp_500_daily_returns_tbl\nStep 2 - Convert to User-Item Format\nThe next step is to convert to a user-item format with the symbol in the first column and every other column the value of the daily returns (pct_return) for every stock at each date.\nWe’re going to import the correct results first (just in case you were not able to complete the last step).\n{r} sp_500_daily_returns_tbl &lt;- read_rds(“sp_500_daily_returns_tbl.rds”) sp_500_daily_returns_tbl\nNow that we have the daily returns (percentage change from one day to the next), we can convert to a user-item format. The user in this case is the symbol (company), and the item in this case is the pct_return at each date.\nSpread the date column to get the values as percentage returns. Make sure to fill an NA values with zeros.\nSave the result as stock_date_matrix_tbl\n{r} # Convert to User-Item Format\n\n\n2 Output: stock_date_matrix_tbl\nStep 3 - Perform K-Means Clustering\nNext, we’ll perform K-Means clustering.\nWe’re going to import the correct results first (just in case you were not able to complete the last step).\n{r} stock_date_matrix_tbl &lt;- read_rds(“stock_date_matrix_tbl.rds”)\nBeginning with the stock_date_matrix_tbl, perform the following operations:\nDrop the non-numeric column, symbol\nPerform kmeans() with centers = 4 and nstart = 20\nSave the result as kmeans_obj\n{r} # Create kmeans_obj for 4 centers\nUse glance() to get the tot.withinss.\n{r} # Apply glance() to get the tot.withinss\nStep 4 - Find the optimal value of K\nNow that we are familiar with the process for calculating kmeans(), let’s use purrr to iterate over many values of “k” using the centers argument.\nWe’ll use this custom function called kmeans_mapper():\n{r} kmeans_mapper &lt;- function(center = 3) { stock_date_matrix_tbl %&gt;% select(-symbol) %&gt;% kmeans(centers = center, nstart = 20) }\nApply the kmeans_mapper() and glance() functions iteratively using purrr.\nCreate a tibble containing column called centers that go from 1 to 30\nAdd a column named k_means with the kmeans_mapper() output. Use mutate() to add the column and map() to map centers to the kmeans_mapper() function.\nAdd a column named glance with the glance() output. Use mutate() and map() again to iterate over the column of k_means.\nSave the output as k_means_mapped_tbl\n{r} # Use purrr to map\n\n\n3 Output: k_means_mapped_tbl\nNext, let’s visualize the “tot.withinss” from the glance output as a Scree Plot.\nBegin with the k_means_mapped_tbl\nUnnest the glance column\nPlot the centers column (x-axis) versus the tot.withinss column (y-axis) using geom_point() and geom_line()\nAdd a title “Scree Plot” and feel free to style it with your favorite theme\n{r} # Visualize Scree Plot\nWe can see that the Scree Plot becomes linear (constant rate of change) between 5 and 10 centers for K.\nStep 5 - Apply UMAP\nNext, let’s plot the UMAP 2D visualization to help us investigate cluster assignments.\nWe’re going to import the correct results first (just in case you were not able to complete the last step).\n{r} k_means_mapped_tbl &lt;- read_rds(“k_means_mapped_tbl.rds”)\nFirst, let’s apply the umap() function to the stock_date_matrix_tbl, which contains our user-item matrix in tibble format.\nStart with stock_date_matrix_tbl\nDe-select the symbol column\nUse the umap() function storing the output as umap_results\n{r} # Apply UMAP\n\n\n4 Store results as: umap_results\nNext, we want to combine the layout from the umap_results with the symbol column from the stock_date_matrix_tbl.\nStart with umap_results$layout\nConvert from a matrix data type to a tibble with as_tibble()\nBind the columns of the umap tibble with the symbol column from the stock_date_matrix_tbl.\nSave the results as umap_results_tbl.\n{r} # Convert umap results to tibble with symbols\n\n\n5 Output: umap_results_tbl\nFinally, let’s make a quick visualization of the umap_results_tbl.\nPipe the umap_results_tbl into ggplot() mapping the columns to x-axis and y-axis\nAdd a geom_point() geometry with an alpha = 0.5\nApply theme_tq() and add a title “UMAP Projection”\n{r} # Visualize UMAP results\nWe can now see that we have some clusters. However, we still need to combine the K-Means clusters and the UMAP 2D representation.\nStep 6 - Combine K-Means and UMAP\nNext, we combine the K-Means clusters and the UMAP 2D representation\nWe’re going to import the correct results first (just in case you were not able to complete the last step).\n{r} k_means_mapped_tbl &lt;- read_rds(“k_means_mapped_tbl.rds”) umap_results_tbl &lt;- read_rds(“umap_results_tbl.rds”)\nFirst, pull out the K-Means for 10 Centers. Use this since beyond this value the Scree Plot flattens. Have a look at the business case to recall how that works.\n{r} # Get the k_means_obj from the 10th center\n\n\n6 Store as k_means_obj\nNext, we’ll combine the clusters from the k_means_obj with the umap_results_tbl.\nBegin with the k_means_obj\nAugment the k_means_obj with the stock_date_matrix_tbl to get the clusters added to the end of the tibble\nSelect just the symbol and .cluster columns\nLeft join the result with the umap_results_tbl by the symbol column\nLeft join the result with the result of sp_500_index_tbl %&gt;% select(symbol, company, sector) by the symbol column.\nStore the output as umap_kmeans_results_tbl\n{r} # Use your dplyr & broom skills to combine the k_means_obj with the umap_results_tbl\n\n\n7 Output: umap_kmeans_results_tbl\nPlot the K-Means and UMAP results.\nBegin with the umap_kmeans_results_tbl\nUse ggplot() mapping V1, V2 and color = .cluster\nAdd the geom_point() geometry with alpha = 0.5\nApply colors as you desire (e.g. scale_color_manual(values = palette_light() %&gt;% rep(3)))\n{r} # Visualize the combined K-Means and UMAP results\nCongratulations! You are done with the 1st challenge!"

Use mutate() and map() again to iterate over the column of k_means.\nSave the output as k_means_mapped_tbl\n{r} # Use purrr to map\n\n\n3 Output: k_means_mapped_tbl\nNext, let’s visualize the “tot.withinss” from the glance output as a Scree Plot.\nBegin with the k_means_mapped_tbl\nUnnest the glance column\nPlot the centers column (x-axis) versus the tot.withinss column (y-axis) using geom_point() and geom_line()\nAdd a title “Scree Plot” and feel free to style it with your favorite theme\n{r} # Visualize Scree Plot\nWe can see that the Scree Plot becomes linear (constant rate of change) between 5 and 10 centers for K.\nStep 5 - Apply UMAP\nNext, let’s plot the UMAP 2D visualization to help us investigate cluster assignments.\nWe’re going to import the correct results first (just in case you were not able to complete the last step).\n{r} k_means_mapped_tbl &lt;- read_rds(“k_means_mapped_tbl.rds”)\nFirst, let’s apply the umap() function to the stock_date_matrix_tbl, which contains our user-item matrix in tibble format.\nStart with stock_date_matrix_tbl\nDe-select the symbol column\nUse the umap() function storing the output as umap_results\n{r} # Apply UMAP\n\n\n4 Store results as: umap_results\nNext, we want to combine the layout from the umap_results with the symbol column from the stock_date_matrix_tbl.\nStart with umap_results$layout\nConvert from a matrix data type to a tibble with as_tibble()\nBind the columns of the umap tibble with the symbol column from the stock_date_matrix_tbl.\nSave the results as umap_results_tbl.\n{r} # Convert umap results to tibble with symbols\n\n\n5 Output: umap_results_tbl\nFinally, let’s make a quick visualization of the umap_results_tbl.\nPipe the umap_results_tbl into ggplot() mapping the columns to x-axis and y-axis\nAdd a geom_point() geometry with an alpha = 0.5\nApply theme_tq() and add a title “UMAP Projection”\n{r} # Visualize UMAP results\nWe can now see that we have some clusters. However, we still need to combine the K-Means clusters and the UMAP 2D representation.\nStep 6 - Combine K-Means and UMAP\nNext, we combine the K-Means clusters and the UMAP 2D representation\nWe’re going to import the correct results first (just in case you were not able to complete the last step).\n{r} k_means_mapped_tbl &lt;- read_rds(“k_means_mapped_tbl.rds”) umap_results_tbl &lt;- read_rds(“umap_results_tbl.rds”)\nFirst, pull out the K-Means for 10 Centers. Use this since beyond this value the Scree Plot flattens. Have a look at the business case to recall how that works.\n{r} # Get the k_means_obj from the 10th center\n\n\n6 Store as k_means_obj\nNext, we’ll combine the clusters from the k_means_obj with the umap_results_tbl.\nBegin with the k_means_obj\nAugment the k_means_obj with the stock_date_matrix_tbl to get the clusters added to the end of the tibble\nSelect just the symbol and .cluster columns\nLeft join the result with the umap_results_tbl by the symbol column\nLeft join the result with the result of sp_500_index_tbl %&gt;% select(symbol, company, sector) by the symbol column.\nStore the output as umap_kmeans_results_tbl\n{r} # Use your dplyr & broom skills to combine the k_means_obj with the umap_results_tbl\n\n\n7 Output: umap_kmeans_results_tbl\nPlot the K-Means and UMAP results.\nBegin with the umap_kmeans_results_tbl\nUse ggplot() mapping V1, V2 and color = .cluster\nAdd the geom_point() geometry with alpha = 0.5\nApply colors as you desire (e.g. scale_color_manual(values = palette_light() %&gt;% rep(3)))\n{r} # Visualize the combined K-Means and UMAP results\nCongratulations! You are done with the 1st challenge!"
